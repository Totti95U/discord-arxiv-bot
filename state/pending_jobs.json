          "summary": "We introduce new families of quandles that serve as invariants for classifying closed orientable surfaces. These families generalize the classical Dehn quandle and are defined, respectively, on isotopy classes of unoriented closed curves and on integral weighted multicurves. We establish their fundamental algebraic properties and construct a natural quandle covering that relates them. We then analyze their metric properties, showing that these quandles are unbounded with respect to the quandle metric. Next, we compute their second bounded quandle cohomology, proving it to be infinite-dimensional. We also establish a version of the Gromov Mapping Theorem, showing that the natural map from an abelian quandle extension onto the original quandle induces an injection on bounded quandle cohomology in every dimension. Finally, inspired by recent developments in quandle rings, we analyze idempotents in the integral quandle rings arising from the classical Dehn quandle of a surface.",

          "summary": "Let $P$ be a set of $n$ points in the plane, not all on a line, each colored \\emph{red} or \\emph{blue}. The classical Motzkin--Rabin theorem guarantees the existence of a \\emph{monochromatic} line. Motivated by the seminal work of Green and Tao (2013) on the Sylvester-Gallai theorem, we investigate the quantitative and structural properties of monochromatic geometric objects, such as lines, circles, and conics.\n  We first show that if no line contains more than three points, then for all sufficiently large $n$ there are at least $n^{2}/24 - O(1)$ monochromatic lines. We then show a converse of a theorem of Jamison (1986): Given $n\\ge 6$ blue points and $n$ red points, if the blue points lie on a conic and every line through two blue points contains a red point, then all red points are collinear. We also settle the smallest nontrivial case of a conjecture of Milićević (2018) by showing that if we have $5$ blue points with no three collinear and $5$ red points, if the blue points lie on a conic and every line through two blue points contains a red point, then all $10$ points lie on a cubic curve. Further, we analyze the random setting and show that, for any non-collinear set of $n\\ge 10$ points independently colored red or blue, the expected number of monochromatic lines is minimized by the \\emph{near-pencil} configuration. Finally, we examine monochromatic circles and conics, and exhibit several natural families in which no such monochromatic objects exist.",

          "summary": "The theory of open quantum systems served as a tool to prepare entanglement at the beginning stage of quantum technology and more recently provides an important tool for state preparation. Dynamics given by time dependent Lindbladians are Markovian and lead to decoherence, decay of correlation and convergence to equilibrium. In contrast Non-Markovian evolutions can outperform their Markovian counterparts by enhancing memory. In this letter we compare the trajectories of Markovian and Non-Markovian evolutions starting from a fixed initial value. It turns out that under mild assumptions every trajectory can be obtained from a family of time dependent Lindbladians. Hence Non-Markovianity is invisible if single trajectories are concerned.",

Building on the structure of the time derivatives of a flat output, we derive sufficient conditions that guarantee such prolongations yield a static feedback linearizable system. In the two-input case, prior work established precise links between relative degrees, the highest derivative orders occurring in a flat parameterization, and the minimal dimension of a linearizing dynamic extension, leading to necessary and sufficient criteria for systems that become static feedback linearizable after at most two prolongations of such suitably chosen inputs. This work extends this analysis to systems with more than two inputs and derives particular results for the three-input case.",

          "summary": "Despite significant progress in post-hoc explanation methods for neural networks, many remain heuristic and lack provable guarantees. A key approach for obtaining explanations with provable guarantees is by identifying a cardinally-minimal subset of input features which by itself is provably sufficient to determine the prediction. However, for standard neural networks, this task is often computationally infeasible, as it demands a worst-case exponential number of verification queries in the number of input features, each of which is NP-hard.\n  In this work, we show that for Neural Additive Models (NAMs), a recent and more interpretable neural network family, we can efficiently generate explanations with such guarantees. We present a new model-specific algorithm for NAMs that generates provably cardinally-minimal explanations using only a logarithmic number of verification queries\n  in the number of input features, after a parallelized preprocessing step with logarithmic runtime in the required precision is applied to each small univariate NAM component.\n  Our algorithm not only makes the task of obtaining cardinally-minimal explanations feasible, but even outperforms existing algorithms designed to find the relaxed variant of subset-minimal explanations - which may be larger and less informative but easier to compute - despite our algorithm solving a much more difficult task.\n  Our experiments demonstrate that, compared to previous algorithms, our approach provides provably smaller explanations than existing works and substantially reduces the computation time. Moreover, we show that our generated provable explanations offer benefits that are unattainable by standard sampling-based techniques typically used to interpret NAMs.",

          "summary": "In the three-body problem with positive energy, solutions which avoid triple collision have the property that the size of the triangle formed by the bodies tends to infinity as $t\\rightarrow \\pm\\infty$. Furthermore, the triangles have well-defined asymptotic shapes $s_\\pm$. The scattering problems asks which asymptotic shape $s_+$ can occur for a given choice of $s_-$. Previous work shows that this can be viewed as the problem of finding heteroclinic orbits connecting equilibrium points on a boundary manifold ``at infinity'' and some results were obtained for solutions which avoid collisions. The goal of this paper is to study the scattering effect of binary and near-triple collisions in a simple setting -- the isosceles three-body problem. The details depend on the mass parameters but in many cases, a fixed isosceles initial shape $s_-$ scatters to essentially all possible isosceles shapes $s_+$.",

The essential ingredient behind the proposed algorithm is Girard's geometry of interaction, which, differently from its well-known uses from the literature, is here leveraged to perform as much of the classical computation as possible, at the same time producing a circuit that, when evaluated, performs all the quantum operations in the underlying $λ$-term. We identify higher-order control flow as the primary obstacle towards efficient solutions to the problem at hand. Notably, geometry of interaction proves sufficiently flexible to enable efficient compilation in many cases, while still supporting a total compilation procedure. Finally, we characterize through a type system those $λ$-terms for which compilation can be performed efficiently.",

          "title": "Directed type theory, with a twist",
          "summary": "In recent years, Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) has had great success both as a foundation of mathematics and as internal language to reason about $\\infty$-groupoids (a.k.a. spaces). However, in many areas of mathematics and computer science, it is often the case that it is categories, not groupoids, which are the more important structures to consider. For this reason, multiple directed type theories have been proposed, i.e., theories whose semantics are based on categories. In this paper, we present a new such type theory, Twisted Type Theory (TTT). It features a novel ``twisting'' operation on types: given a type that depends both contravariantly and covariantly on some variables, its twist is a new type that depends only covariantly on the same variables. To provide the semantics of this operation, we introduce the notion of dependent 2-sided fibrations (D2SFibs), which generalize Street's notion of 2-sided fibrations. We develop the basic theory of D2SFibs, as well as characterize them through a straightening-unstraightening theorem. With these results in hand, we introduce a new elimination rule for Hom-types. We argue that our syntax and semantics satisfy key features that allow reasoning in a HoTT-like style, which allows us to mimic the proof techniques of that setting. We end the paper by exemplifying this, and use TTT to reason about categories, giving a syntactic proof of Yoneda's lemma.",

This study focuses on lobe dynamics to exploit local chaotic transport around celestial bodies, and proposes a new method for systematically designing low-energy transfers by combining multiple lobe dynamics. A graph-based framework is constructed to explore possible transfer paths between departure and arrival orbits, reducing the complexity of the combinatorial optimization problem for designing fuel-efficient transfers. Based on this graph, low-energy transfer trajectories are constructed by connecting chaotic orbits within lobes. The resulting optimal trajectory in the Earth--Moon CR3BP is then converted into an optimal transfer in the bicircular restricted four-body problem using multiple shooting. The obtained transfer is compared with existing optimal solutions to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

Generalising the soluble groups of Herbert Abels to a large family over many integral domains, we prove that most such groups have property~$R_\\infty$ drawing from a classical result of Levchuk and a swift observation by Jabara. Within the broad programme of cataloguing finitely generated groups up to quasi-isometry, our groups can then be separated by finiteness properties and cohomological dimension whilst having~$R_\\infty$. Abandoning finite presentability, we establish that property~$R_\\infty$ is very abundant in a strong sense: there are uncountably many finitely generated groups (which can all be chosen to be amenable or non-amenable) that have~$R_\\infty$ and are pairwise not quasi-isometric. The proofs vary in flavour. On the amenable side we use carefully constructed quotients of Abels' groups and a general strategy for quasi-isometric diversity established by Minasyan, Osin, and Witzel. For the non-amenable constructions we rely on modifications of Leary's type $\\mathtt{FP}$ groups, further cohomological arguments, and recent powerful criteria for~$R_\\infty$ due to Iveson, Martino, Sgobbi, Wong, and Fournier-Facio.",

Here we unify the definitions of these three classes of languages into one uniform definition in two ways: via the method of partial orders and via the method of transducers.

          "summary": "Cryptographic security is traditionally formulated using game-based or simulation-based definitions. In this paper, we propose a structural reformulation of cryptographic security based on Grothendieck topologies and sheaf theory.\n  Our key idea is to model attacker observations as a Grothendieck site, where covering families represent admissible decompositions of partial information determined by efficient simulation. Within this framework, protocol transcripts naturally form sheaves, and security properties arise as geometric conditions.\n  As a first step, we focus on $Σ$-protocols. We show that the transcript structure of any $Σ$-protocol defines a torsor in the associated topos of sheaves. Local triviality of this torsor corresponds to zero-knowledge, while the absence of global sections reflects soundness. A concrete analysis of the Schnorr $Σ$-protocol is provided to illustrate the construction.\n  This sheaf-theoretic perspective offers a conceptual explanation of simulation-based security and suggests a geometric foundation for further cryptographic abstractions.",

When $S$ is finite, we define the DSC coefficient $χ(S)$ to be the ratio of the number of congruences to the number of diagonal subsemigroups.

          "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on developing models that can autonomously learn optimal decision-making strategies over time. In a recent pioneering paper, Wagner demonstrated how the Deep Cross-Entropy RL method can be applied to tackle various problems from extremal graph theory by reformulating them as combinatorial optimization problems. Subsequently, many researchers became interested in refining and extending the framework introduced by Wagner, thereby creating various RL environments specialized for graph theory. Moreover, a number of problems from extremal graph theory were solved through the use of RL. In particular, several inequalities concerning the Laplacian spectral radius of graphs were refuted, new lower bounds were obtained for certain Ramsey numbers, and contributions were made to the Turán-type extremal problem in which the forbidden structures are cycles of length three and four. Here, we present Reinforcement Learning for Graph Theory (RLGT), a novel RL framework that systematizes the previous work and provides support for both undirected and directed graphs, with or without loops, and with an arbitrary number of edge colors. The framework efficiently represents graphs and aims to facilitate future RL-based research in extremal graph theory through optimized computational performance and a clean and modular design.",

Within this setting, informational truth is characterized as stability under repeated agentive interaction rather than correspondence to a fixed global state.\n  By integrating description logic with procedural dynamics, oracle-based reasoning, and sheaf-theoretic semantics, TAPO--DL offers a principled formal framework for analyzing information behavior in contexts involving interaction, uncertainty, and contextuality.",

BDD is an agile methodology in which system behavior is specified through textual scenarios that, in our approach, are translated into transition systems used for model-based testing. This paper formally defines disjunction composition, to combine BDD transition systems that represent alternative system behaviors. Disjunction composition allows for modeling and testing the integrated behavior while ensuring that the testing power of the original set of scenarios is preserved. This is proved using a symbolic semantics for BDD transition systems, with the property that the symbolic equivalence of two BDD transition systems guarantees that they fail the same test cases. Also, we demonstrate the potential of disjunction composition by applying the composition in an industrial case study.",

Compared to other types of generative AI models, such as GANs and VAEs, the sampling speed is known as a key disadvantage of diffusion models. By systematically comparing transport-based generative models on a numerical example of 2D Kolmogorov flows, we show that flow matching in a lower-dimensional latent space is suited for fast sampling of stochastic closure models, enabling single-step sampling that is up to two orders of magnitude faster than iterative diffusion-based approaches. To control the latent space distortion and thus ensure the physical fidelity of the sampled closure term, we compare the implicit regularization offered by a joint training scheme against two explicit regularizers: metric-preserving (MP) and geometry-aware (GA) constraints. Besides offering a faster sampling speed, both explicitly and implicitly regularized latent spaces inherit the key topological information from the lower-dimensional manifold of the original complex dynamical system, which enables the learning of stochastic closure models without demanding a huge amount of training data.",

Gromov's filling area conjecture in differential geometry from 1983 asserts that among all compact, orientable Riemannian surfaces which isometrically fill the Riemannian circle, the one with the smallest surface area is the hemisphere. Gromov demonstrated that this is indeed the case if $M$ is homeomorphic to the disk. While Gromov's conjecture has since been verified in some other cases, the full conjecture remains unresolved.\n  In this paper, we consider a discrete analogue of Gromov's problem, which is likely natural to those who study graph embeddings on arbitrary surfaces. Using standard graph-theoretic tools, such as Menger's theorem, we obtain reasonable asymptotic bounds on this discrete variant. We then demonstrate how these discrete bounds can be translated to the continuous setting, showing that any isometric filling of the Riemannian circle of length $2π$ has surface area at least $1.36π$ (the hemisphere has surface area $2π$). This appears to be the first quantitative lower-bound on Gromov's problem that applies to arbitrary isometric fillings.",

We reproduce the known results for orders less than 24, and enumerate the nilpotent loops of order 24 with center of size at least 3.",

These families generalize the classical Dehn quandle and are defined, respectively, on isotopy classes of unoriented closed curves and on integral weighted multicurves. We establish their fundamental algebraic properties and construct a natural quandle covering that relates them. We then analyze their metric properties, showing that these quandles are unbounded with respect to the quandle metric. Next, we compute their second bounded quandle cohomology, proving it to be infinite-dimensional. We also establish a version of the Gromov Mapping Theorem, showing that the natural map from an abelian quandle extension onto the original quandle induces an injection on bounded quandle cohomology in every dimension. Finally, inspired by recent developments in quandle rings, we analyze idempotents in the integral quandle rings arising from the classical Dehn quandle of a surface.",

The classical Motzkin--Rabin theorem guarantees the existence of a \\emph{monochromatic} line. Motivated by the seminal work of Green and Tao (2013) on the Sylvester-Gallai theorem, we investigate the quantitative and structural properties of monochromatic geometric objects, such as lines, circles, and conics.\n  We first show that if no line contains more than three points, then for all sufficiently large $n$ there are at least $n^{2}/24 - O(1)$ monochromatic lines. We then show a converse of a theorem of Jamison (1986): Given $n\\ge 6$ blue points and $n$ red points, if the blue points lie on a conic and every line through two blue points contains a red point, then all red points are collinear. We also settle the smallest nontrivial case of a conjecture of Milićević (2018) by showing that if we have $5$ blue points with no three collinear and $5$ red points, if the blue points lie on a conic and every line through two blue points contains a red point, then all $10$ points lie on a cubic curve. Further, we analyze the random setting and show that, for any non-collinear set of $n\\ge 10$ points independently colored red or blue, the expected number of monochromatic lines is minimized by the \\emph{near-pencil} configuration. Finally, we examine monochromatic circles and conics, and exhibit several natural families in which no such monochromatic objects exist.",

In contrast Non-Markovian evolutions can outperform their Markovian counterparts by enhancing memory. In this letter we compare the trajectories of Markovian and Non-Markovian evolutions starting from a fixed initial value. It turns out that under mild assumptions every trajectory can be obtained from a family of time dependent Lindbladians. Hence Non-Markovianity is invisible if single trajectories are concerned.",

On the one hand, our results extend the line of work originating with Fagin and Glebskii et al. on zero-one laws for dense random graphs, as well as the zero-one law of Shelah and Spencer for sparse random graphs.

In the two-input case, prior work established precise links between relative degrees, the highest derivative orders occurring in a flat parameterization, and the minimal dimension of a linearizing dynamic extension, leading to necessary and sufficient criteria for systems that become static feedback linearizable after at most two prolongations of such suitably chosen inputs.

          "summary": "Despite significant progress in post-hoc explanation methods for neural networks, many remain heuristic and lack provable guarantees. A key approach for obtaining explanations with provable guarantees is by identifying a cardinally-minimal subset of input features which by itself is provably sufficient to determine the prediction. However, for standard neural networks, this task is often computationally infeasible, as it demands a worst-case exponential number of verification queries in the number of input features, each of which is NP-hard.\n  In this work, we show that for Neural Additive Models (NAMs), a recent and more interpretable neural network family, we can efficiently generate explanations with such guarantees. We present a new model-specific algorithm for NAMs that generates provably cardinally-minimal explanations using only a logarithmic number of verification queries\n  in the number of input features, after a parallelized preprocessing step with logarithmic runtime in the required precision is applied to each small univariate NAM component.\n  Our algorithm not only makes the task of obtaining cardinally-minimal explanations feasible, but even outperforms existing algorithms designed to find the relaxed variant of subset-minimal explanations - which may be larger and less informative but easier to compute - despite our algorithm solving a much more difficult task.\n  Our experiments demonstrate that, compared to previous algorithms, our approach provides provably smaller explanations than existing works and substantially reduces the computation time. Moreover, we show that our generated provable explanations offer benefits that are unattainable by standard sampling-based techniques typically used to interpret NAMs.",

Furthermore, the triangles have well-defined asymptotic shapes $s_\\pm$. The scattering problems asks which asymptotic shape $s_+$ can occur for a given choice of $s_-$. Previous work shows that this can be viewed as the problem of finding heteroclinic orbits connecting equilibrium points on a boundary manifold ``at infinity'' and some results were obtained for solutions which avoid collisions. The goal of this paper is to study the scattering effect of binary and near-triple collisions in a simple setting -- the isosceles three-body problem. The details depend on the mass parameters but in many cases, a fixed isosceles initial shape $s_-$ scatters to essentially all possible isosceles shapes $s_+$.",

We identify higher-order control flow as the primary obstacle towards efficient solutions to the problem at hand. Notably, geometry of interaction proves sufficiently flexible to enable efficient compilation in many cases, while still supporting a total compilation procedure.

          "summary": "In recent years, Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) has had great success both as a foundation of mathematics and as internal language to reason about $\\infty$-groupoids (a.k.a. spaces). However, in many areas of mathematics and computer science, it is often the case that it is categories, not groupoids, which are the more important structures to consider. For this reason, multiple directed type theories have been proposed, i.e., theories whose semantics are based on categories. In this paper, we present a new such type theory, Twisted Type Theory (TTT). It features a novel ``twisting'' operation on types: given a type that depends both contravariantly and covariantly on some variables, its twist is a new type that depends only covariantly on the same variables. To provide the semantics of this operation, we introduce the notion of dependent 2-sided fibrations (D2SFibs), which generalize Street's notion of 2-sided fibrations. We develop the basic theory of D2SFibs, as well as characterize them through a straightening-unstraightening theorem. With these results in hand, we introduce a new elimination rule for Hom-types. We argue that our syntax and semantics satisfy key features that allow reasoning in a HoTT-like style, which allows us to mimic the proof techniques of that setting. We end the paper by exemplifying this, and use TTT to reason about categories, giving a syntactic proof of Yoneda's lemma.",

This study focuses on lobe dynamics to exploit local chaotic transport around celestial bodies, and proposes a new method for systematically designing low-energy transfers by combining multiple lobe dynamics. A graph-based framework is constructed to explore possible transfer paths between departure and arrival orbits, reducing the complexity of the combinatorial optimization problem for designing fuel-efficient transfers. Based on this graph, low-energy transfer trajectories are constructed by connecting chaotic orbits within lobes. The resulting optimal trajectory in the Earth--Moon CR3BP is then converted into an optimal transfer in the bicircular restricted four-body problem using multiple shooting. The obtained transfer is compared with existing optimal solutions to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

Generalising the soluble groups of Herbert Abels to a large family over many integral domains, we prove that most such groups have property~$R_\\infty$ drawing from a classical result of Levchuk and a swift observation by Jabara. Within the broad programme of cataloguing finitely generated groups up to quasi-isometry, our groups can then be separated by finiteness properties and cohomological dimension whilst having~$R_\\infty$. Abandoning finite presentability, we establish that property~$R_\\infty$ is very abundant in a strong sense: there are uncountably many finitely generated groups (which can all be chosen to be amenable or non-amenable) that have~$R_\\infty$ and are pairwise not quasi-isometric. The proofs vary in flavour. On the amenable side we use carefully constructed quotients of Abels' groups and a general strategy for quasi-isometric diversity established by Minasyan, Osin, and Witzel.

          "summary": "A prefix code L satisfies the condition that no word of L is a proper prefix of another word of L. Recently, Ko, Han and Salomaa relaxed this condition by allowing a word of L to be a proper prefix of at most k words of L, for some `margin' k, introducing thus the class of k-prefix-free languages, as well as the similar classes of k-suffix-free and k-infix-free languages. Here we unify the definitions of these three classes of languages into one uniform definition in two ways: via the method of partial orders and via the method of transducers. Thus, for any known class of code-related languages definable via the transducer method, one gets a marginal version of that class. Building on the techniques of Ko, Han and Salomaa, we discuss the \\emph{uniform} satisfaction and maximality problems for marginal classes of languages.",

In this paper, we propose a structural reformulation of cryptographic security based on Grothendieck topologies and sheaf theory.\n  Our key idea is to model attacker observations as a Grothendieck site, where covering families represent admissible decompositions of partial information determined by efficient simulation. Within this framework, protocol transcripts naturally form sheaves, and security properties arise as geometric conditions.\n  As a first step, we focus on $Σ$-protocols. We show that the transcript structure of any $Σ$-protocol defines a torsor in the associated topos of sheaves. Local triviality of this torsor corresponds to zero-knowledge, while the absence of global sections reflects soundness. A concrete analysis of the Schnorr $Σ$-protocol is provided to illustrate the construction.\n  This sheaf-theoretic perspective offers a conceptual explanation of simulation-based security and suggests a geometric foundation for further cryptographic abstractions.",

When $S$ is finite, we define the DSC coefficient $χ(S)$ to be the ratio of the number of congruences to the number of diagonal subsemigroups.

          "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on developing models that can autonomously learn optimal decision-making strategies over time. In a recent pioneering paper, Wagner demonstrated how the Deep Cross-Entropy RL method can be applied to tackle various problems from extremal graph theory by reformulating them as combinatorial optimization problems. Subsequently, many researchers became interested in refining and extending the framework introduced by Wagner, thereby creating various RL environments specialized for graph theory. Moreover, a number of problems from extremal graph theory were solved through the use of RL. In particular, several inequalities concerning the Laplacian spectral radius of graphs were refuted, new lower bounds were obtained for certain Ramsey numbers, and contributions were made to the Turán-type extremal problem in which the forbidden structures are cycles of length three and four. Here, we present Reinforcement Learning for Graph Theory (RLGT), a novel RL framework that systematizes the previous work and provides support for both undirected and directed graphs, with or without loops, and with an arbitrary number of edge colors. The framework efficiently represents graphs and aims to facilitate future RL-based research in extremal graph theory through optimized computational performance and a clean and modular design.",

Within this setting, informational truth is characterized as stability under repeated agentive interaction rather than correspondence to a fixed global state.\n  By integrating description logic with procedural dynamics, oracle-based reasoning, and sheaf-theoretic semantics, TAPO--DL offers a principled formal framework for analyzing information behavior in contexts involving interaction, uncertainty, and contextuality.",

Analogous statements are obtained for schemes.\n  (iii) For a homogeneous ideal in a standard graded polynomial ring over a field, we compare its Serre depths with those of its initial ideal.\n  (iv) We characterize the Serre depths of a monomial ideal in terms of its skeletons and prove that the Serre depths of sufficiently large powers of a monomial ideal stabilize; the proof uses Presburger arithmetic.",

BDD is an agile methodology in which system behavior is specified through textual scenarios that, in our approach, are translated into transition systems used for model-based testing. This paper formally defines disjunction composition, to combine BDD transition systems that represent alternative system behaviors. Disjunction composition allows for modeling and testing the integrated behavior while ensuring that the testing power of the original set of scenarios is preserved. This is proved using a symbolic semantics for BDD transition systems, with the property that the symbolic equivalence of two BDD transition systems guarantees that they fail the same test cases. Also, we demonstrate the potential of disjunction composition by applying the composition in an industrial case study.",

The setting can be extended to probabilistic procedures, in which the decision to park left or right is random.

Compared to other types of generative AI models, such as GANs and VAEs, the sampling speed is known as a key disadvantage of diffusion models. By systematically comparing transport-based generative models on a numerical example of 2D Kolmogorov flows, we show that flow matching in a lower-dimensional latent space is suited for fast sampling of stochastic closure models, enabling single-step sampling that is up to two orders of magnitude faster than iterative diffusion-based approaches. To control the latent space distortion and thus ensure the physical fidelity of the sampled closure term, we compare the implicit regularization offered by a joint training scheme against two explicit regularizers: metric-preserving (MP) and geometry-aware (GA) constraints. Besides offering a faster sampling speed, both explicitly and implicitly regularized latent spaces inherit the key topological information from the lower-dimensional manifold of the original complex dynamical system, which enables the learning of stochastic closure models without demanding a huge amount of training data.",

Serrano proposed a corresponding definition of skew shifted plactic Schur functions. Cho (2013) disproved Serrano's conjecture regarding this definition, by showing that the functions do not live in the desired ring and hence cannot provide an algebraic interpretation of tableau rectification or of the corresponding structure coefficients. Cho asked for a new definition with particular properties. We introduce such a definition and prove that it behaves as desired. We also introduce a new jeu de taquin theory that computes mixed insertion.",

Extending the prefix-sum description of the ASM polytope, we develop a uniform core--assembly framework: each symmetry class is encoded by a set of core positions and an affine assembly map that reconstructs the full matrix from its core. This reduction transfers polyhedral questions to lower-dimensional core polytopes, which are better suited to the tool set of polyhedral combinatorics, while retaining complete information about the original symmetry class. For the vertical, vertical--horizontal, half-turn, diagonal, diagonal--antidiagonal, and total symmetry classes, we give explicit polynomial-size linear inequality descriptions of the associated polytopes. In these cases, we also determine the dimension and provide facet descriptions. The quarter-turn symmetry class behaves differently: the natural relaxation admits fractional vertices, and we need to extend the system with a structured family of parity-type Chvátal--Gomory inequalities to obtain the quarter-turn symmetric ASM polytope. Our framework leads to efficient algorithms for computing minimum-cost ASMs in each symmetry class and provides a direct link between the combinatorics of symmetric ASMs and tools from polyhedral combinatorics and combinatorial optimization.",

          "summary": "The expressive power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is often analysed via correspondence to the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) algorithm and fragments of first-order logic. Standard GNNs are limited to performing aggregation over immediate neighbourhoods or over global read-outs. To increase their expressivity, recent attempts have been made to incorporate substructural information (e.g. cycle counts and subgraph properties). In this paper, we formalize this architectural trend by introducing Template GNNs (T-GNNs), a generalized framework where node features are updated by aggregating over valid template embeddings from a specified set of graph templates. We propose a corresponding logic, Graded template modal logic (GML(T)), and generalized notions of template-based bisimulation and WL algorithm. We establish an equivalence between the expressive power of T-GNNs and GML(T), and provide a unifying approach for analysing GNN expressivity: we show how standard AC-GNNs and its recent variants can be interpreted as instantiations of T-GNNs.",

Moreover, this bound is tight for infinitely many uniformities $r$ and all sufficiently large $\\ell$ in the corresponding residue classes modulo $r$.

In this paper, we study entailment of inclusion dependencies over K-databases, where K is a positive commutative monoid. We establish a dichotomy regarding the axiomatisation of the entailment of inclusion dependencies over K-databases, based on whether the monoid K is weakly absorptive or weakly cancellative. We establish that, if the monoid is weakly cancellative then the standard axioms of inclusion dependencies are sound and complete for the implication problem. If the monoid is not weakly cancellative, it is weakly absorptive and the standard axioms of inclusion dependencies together with the weak symmetry axiom are sound and complete for the implication problem. In addition, we establish that the so-called balance axiom is further required, if one stipulates that the joint weights of each K-relation of a K-database need to be the same; this generalises the notion of a K-relation being a distribution. In conjunction with the balance axiom, weak symmetry axiom boils down to symmetry.",

The same question was left open for graphs, with only a few tractable cases known to date. In this paper, we focus on graph classes that capture incidence relations such as bipartite, co-bipartite, and split graphs. Concerning maximal irredundant sets, we show that the problem on co-bipartite graphs is as hard as in general graphs and tractable in split and strongly orderable graphs, the latter being a generalization of chordal bipartite graphs. As for minimal redundant sets enumeration, we first show that the problem is intractable in split and co-bipartite graphs, answering the aforementioned open question, and that it is tractable on $(C_3,C_5,C_6,C_8)$-free graphs, a class of graphs incomparable to strongly orderable graphs, and which also generalizes chordal bipartite graphs.",

We consider the problem of constructing graphs containing certain fixed small subgraphs.\n  We provide an optimal strategy for building a graph which contains a copy of $K_4$, showing that budget $b=ω(\\max\\{n^8/t^5,n^2/t\\})$ suffices and that if $b=o(\\max\\{n^8/t^5,n^2/t\\})$ then no strategy can a.a.s. produce a graph containing a copy of $K_4$. This resolves a problem raised by Iľkovič, León and Shu. More generally, we obtain analogously tight results for containing a wheel of any fixed size, or a graph consisting of a tree plus one additional universal vertex.

          "summary": "The bialgebraic abstract GSOS framework by Turi and Plotkin provides an elegant categorical approach to modelling the operational and denotational semantics of programming and process languages. In abstract GSOS, bisimilarity is always a congruence, and it coincides with denotational equivalence. This saves the language designer from intricate, ad-hoc reasoning to establish these properties. The bialgebraic perspective on operational semantics in the style of abstract GSOS has recently been extended to higher-order languages, preserving compositionality of bisimilarity. However, a categorical understanding of bialgebraic denotational semantics according to Turi and Plotkin's original vision has so far been missing in the higher-order setting. In the present paper, we develop a theory of adequate denotational semantics in higher-order abstract GSOS. The denotational models are parametric in an appropriately chosen semantic domain in the form of a locally final coalgebra for a behaviour bifunctor, whose construction is fully decoupled from the syntax of the language. Our approach captures existing accounts of denotational semantics such as semantic domains built via general step-indexing, previously introduced on a per-language basis, and is shown to be applicable to a wide range of different higher-order languages, e.g. simply typed and untyped languages, or languages with computational effects such as probabilistic or non-deterministic branching.",

          "summary": "A signed graph $(G,σ)$ consists of a graph $G$ and the signature $σ: E(G) \\rightarrow \\{+1,-1\\}$. An incidence of $G$ is a pair $(v,e)$, where $v$ is one of the end vertices of an edge $e \\in E(G)$. A proper $q$-edge coloring $γ$ of signed graph $(G,σ)$ is an assignment of colors to incidences satisfying that $γ(v,e) = - σ(e) γ(w,e)$ for every edge $e=vw$ and for any two incidences $(v,e)$ and $(v,f)$, involving the same vertex, $γ(v,e) \\neq γ(v,f)$. The chromatic index of a signed graph $(G,σ)$, denoted by $χ'(G,σ)$, is the minimum number $q$ for which $(G,σ)$ has a proper $q$-edge coloring. In this paper, we determine the chromatic index of signed generalized book graphs. We also determine the chromatic index of signed complete graphs of order up to six.",

          "summary": "We present a Rice-like complexity lower bound for any MSO-definable problem on binary structures succinctly encoded by circuits. This work extends the framework recently developed as a counterpoint to Courcelle's theorem for graphs encoded by circuits, in two interplaying directions: (1) by allowing multiple binary relations, and (2) by restricting the interpretation of new symbols. Depending on the pair of an MSO problem $ψ$ and an MSO restriction $χ$, the problem is proven to be NP-hard or coNP-hard or P-hard, as long as $ψ$ is non-trivial on structures satisfying $χ$ with bounded clique-width. Indeed, there are P-complete problems (for logspace reductions) in our extended context. Finally, we strengthen a previous result on the necessity to parameterize the notion of non-triviality, hence supporting the choice of clique-width.",

          "summary": "The field of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) studies homomorphism problems between relational structures where the target structure is fixed. Classifying the complexity of these problems has been a central quest of the field, notably when both sides are finite structures. In this paper, we study the generalization where the input is an automatic structure -- potentially infinite, but describable by finite automata. We prove a striking dichotomy: homomorphism problems over automatic structures are either decidable in non-deterministic logarithmic space (NL), or undecidable. We show that structures for which the problem is decidable are exactly those with finite duality, which is a classical property of target structures asserting that the existence of a homomorphism into them can be characterized by the absence of a finite set of obstructions in the source structure. Notably, this property precisely characterizes target structures whose homomorphism problem is definable in first-order logic, which is well-known to be decidable over automatic structures. We also consider a natural variant of the problem. While automatic structures are finitely describable, homomorphisms from them into finite structures need not be. This leads to the notion of regular homomorphism, where the homomorphism itself must be describable by finite automata. Remarkably, we prove that this variant exhibits the same dichotomy, with the same characterization for decidability.",

Their original proof is probabilistic; we present an explicit construction. Moreover, in the case $k=2$, we show that one can even realize a graph that has arbitrarily large girth and chromatic number simultaneously. We also answer a question of Pálvölgyi on coloring sets of integers with respect to certain finite arithmetic progressions. Finally, we give an application to coloring partially ordered sets.",

An outer system describes the process architecture in which a sequence of actions represents the communication between sub-systems through a global bus. Actions are either permitted or blocked locally by guards; these guards read and decide based on the sequence of actions so far in the global bus.\n  When HCS have both the outer systems and the local guard controllers modelled by finite automata, we show they have the same expressive power as regular languages and finite automata, but they are exponentially more succinct. We also analyse games on this model, representing the interaction between environment and controller, and show that solving such games is EXPTIME-complete, where the lower bound already holds for reachability/safety games and the upper bound holds for any $ω$-regular winning condition. Finally, we consider HCS with guards of greater expressive power, Vector Addition Systems with States (VASS). We show that with deterministic coverability-VASS guards the reachability problem is EXPSPACE-complete, while with reachability-VASS the problem is undecidable.",

          "summary": "Awareness-Based Indistinguishability Logic (henceforth, AIL) is an extension of Epistemic Logic by introducing the notion of awareness, distinguishing explicit knowledge from implicit knowledge. In this framework, each of these notions is represented by a modal operator. On the other hand, HMS models, developed in the economics literature, also provide a formalization of those notions. Nevertheless, the behavior of the epistemic operators in AIL within HMS models has yet to be explored. In this paper, we define a transformation of an AIL model into an HMS model and then prove that a translation between the fragments of the language of AIL preserves truth under this transformation. As a result, we clarify the semantic role of an epistemic operator in AIL, which is induced by awareness and is essential to defining explicit knowledge, within HMS models. Furthermore, we demonstrate the differences in the implicit knowledge captured by AIL and HMS models. This work lays the groundwork for a comparative analysis between the model classes.",

          "summary": "A class of dissipative dynamical systems evolving on smooth constraint hypersurfaces endowed with degenerate induced bilinear forms is studied. The intrinsic evolution is generated by constraint--preserving vector fields on manifolds whose tangent bundles admit a nontrivial null distribution associated with the degeneracy of the induced structure. In this indefinite setting, the absence of coercive Lyapunov functionals prevents the direct application of classical attractor theory developed for Riemannian phase spaces. Dissipation is instead characterized relative to functionals that are compatible with the null distribution and exhibit decay exclusively in directions transverse to the associated foliation. Under suitable involutivity and regularity assumptions on the null distribution, all bounded trajectories are shown to be asymptotically confined to invariant leaves of the corresponding foliation. Asymptotic compactness of the intrinsic evolution is then established without coercivity by reducing the dynamics to a projected semiflow on the quotient manifold determined by the characteristic distribution. In the presence of a bounded absorbing set and continuous semiflow structure, the intrinsic evolution admits a compact global attractor saturated by the null leaves, whose effective asymptotic dynamics are governed by a compact invariant subset of the reduced phase space. Furthermore, when the compatible functional satisfies a Morse--type nondegeneracy condition in directions transverse to the null distribution and the induced transversal linearization admits no center spectrum, the projected semiflow possesses no neutral directions. The resulting framework provides a mechanism by which constraint--induced degeneracy enforces effective dimensional reduction in dissipative geometric evolution systems.",

          "summary": "To ensure decidability and consistency of its type theory, a proof assistant should only accept terminating recursive functions and productive corecursive functions. Most proof assistants enforce this through syntactic conditions, which can be restrictive and non-modular. Sized types are a type-based alternative where (co)inductive types are annotated with additional size information. Well-founded induction on sizes can then be used to prove termination and productivity. An implementation of sized types exists in Agda, but it is currently inconsistent due to the addition of a largest size. We investigate an alternative approach, where intensional type theory is extended with a large type of sizes and parametric quantifiers over sizes. We show that inductive and coinductive types can be constructed in this theory, which improves on earlier work where this was only possible for the finitely-branching inductive types. The consistency of the theory is justified by an impredicative realisability model, which interprets the type of sizes as an uncountable ordinal.",

This paper focuses on optimal two-dimensional optical orthogonal codes with autocorrelation and cross-correlation both equal to $1$. By examining the structures of $n$-cyclic group divisible packings and semi-cyclic incomplete holey group divisible designs, we present new combinatorial constructions for two-dimensional $(m\\times n,k,1)$-optical orthogonal codes. As a consequence, the exact number of codewords of an optimal two-dimensional $(m\\times n,3,1)$-optical orthogonal code is determined for any positive integers $m$ and $n$.",

          "summary": "Dependently-typed proof assistants furnish expressive foundations for mechanised mathematics and verified software. However, automation for these systems has been either modest in scope or complex in implementation. We aim to improve the situation by integrating proof assistants with automated theorem provers (ATPs) in a simple way, while preserving the correctness guarantees of the former. A central difficulty arises from the fact that most ATPs operate in classical first-order logic, whereas these proof assistants are grounded in constructive dependent type theory. We identify an expressive fragment of both languages -- essentially equational Horn -- that admits sound, straightforward translations in both directions. The approach produces a prototype system for Agda forwarding proof obligations to the ATP Vampire, then transforming the resulting classical proof into a constructive proof term that Agda can type-check. The prototype automatically derives proofs concerning the properties of a complex field equipped with roots of unity, which took professional Agda developers two full days to complete. The required engineering effort is modest, and we anticipate that the methodology will extend readily to other ATPs and proof assistants.",

Our goal in this paper is to study the bifurcation diagram in the $(β,c)$ parameter space and identify the nature of the trajectories corresponding to viscous shock waves.

          "summary": "A set $D$ of vertices in a graph $G = (V, E)$ is a locating-dominating set (LD-set) if it is dominating and every two vertices $u$, $v$ of $V\\setminus D$ satisfy $N(u) \\cap D \\neq N(v) \\cap D$. Two disjoint sets $A,B\\subset V(G)$ form a locating-dominating coalition (for short, an LD-coalition) in $G$ if none of them is an LD-set in $G$ but their union $A\\cup B$ is an LD-set. A locating-dominating coalition partition (for short, an LDC-partition) is a vertex partition $Π$ such that every set of $Π$ is not an LD-set in $G,$ but forms an LD-coalition with another set of $Π$. The locating-domination coalition number of $G$, denoted by $C_{L}(G),$ equals the maximum cardinality of an LDC-partition of $G$. Our purpose in this paper is to initiate the study of locating-dominating coalitions in graphs. We first investigate the existence of LDC-partitions. We also obtain lower and upper bounds on $C_{L}(G)$. We characterize connected graphs $G$ of order $n\\ge 3$ satisfying $C_L(G) = n,$ as well as those trees $T$ such that $C_L(T)=n-1$. In addition, we determine the exact values of $C_L(G)$ for some classes of graphs. Moreover, we investigate the computational complexity of the decision problem associated with locating-dominating coalition partitions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses the algorithmic complexity of a decision problem related to coalition partitions, not only for this locating-dominating model but for coalition partitions in general.",

          "summary": "The foundational impossibility results of distributed computing -- the Fischer-Lynch-Paterson theorem, the Two Generals Problem, the CAP theorem -- are widely understood as discoveries about the physical limits of coordination. This paper argues that they are nothing of the sort. They are consequences of a category mistake: treating Forward-In-Time-Only (FITO) information flow as a law of nature rather than recognizing it as a design choice inherited from Shannon's channel model and Lamport's happened-before relation. We develop this argument in six steps. First, we introduce the category mistake framework from Ryle through Spekkens' ontic/epistemic distinction in quantum foundations. Second, we identify FITO as the hidden axiom that unifies the classical impossibility results. Third, we apply Spekkens' Leibnizian principle to show that FITO-based models contain surplus ontological structure. Fourth, we develop the counterfactual: what changes when FITO is dropped. Fifth, we demonstrate that the impossibility theorems are theorems about FITO systems, not about physics. Sixth, we sketch the transactional alternative -- bilateral interactions that dissolve the apparent impossibilities by replacing unidirectional message passing with atomic bilateral transactions. The implication is that distributed computing has spent fifty years optimizing within the wrong design space.",

The system we consider is in non-standard GSPT form and is characterized by a rich dynamical behavior: families of slow-fast homoclinic orbits, canard-like transitions generated by trajectories that remain close to a repelling critical manifold, and topological changes produced by infinitesimal variations of the infection rate, including the creation and destruction of an endemic equilibrium. We conclude with a numerical exploration of the model, to illustrate our analytical results.",

For hypersequent calculi, that argument lifted the ordering to the powerset, since a hypersequent is a (multi)set of sequents. This induces a jump from Ackermannian to hyper-Ackermannian complexity in the fast-growing hierarchy, suggesting that cut-free hypersequent calculi for extensions of the commutative Full Lambek calculus with contraction or weakening ($\\mathbf{FL_{ec}}$/$\\mathbf{FL_{ew}}$) inherently entail hyper-Ackermannian upper bounds. We show that this intuition does not hold: every extension of $\\mathbf{FL_{ec}}$ and $\\mathbf{FL_{ew}}$ admitting a cut-free hypersequent calculus has an Ackermannian upper bound on provability.\n  To avoid the powerset, we exploit novel dependencies between individual sequents within any hypersequent in backward proof search. The weakening case, in particular, introduces a Karp-Miller style acceleration, and it improves the upper bound for the fundamental fuzzy logic $\\mathbf{MTL}$. Our Ackermannian upper bound is optimal for the contraction case (realized by the logic $\\mathbf{FL_{ec}}$).",

This paper investigates the relationship between atom decomposition and the maximum cardinality search (MCS) ordering in general undirected graphs. Specifically, we prove that applying a convex extension to the node numbered $1$ and its neighborhood in an MCS ordering yields an atom in the graph. Furthermore, based on the MCS ordering, we introduce a recursive algorithm for decomposing an undirected graph into its atoms. This approach closely aligns with the results of chordal graph decomposition. As a result, minimal triangulation of the graph is no longer required, and the identification of clique minimal separators is avoided. In the experimental section, we combine the proposed decomposition algorithm with two existing convex expansion methods. The results show that both combinations significantly outperform the existing algorithms in terms of efficiency.",

          "summary": "This paper examines the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) from a novel perspective, focusing on their ability to operate within formally specified, rule-governed environments. We evaluate four LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro and Flash variants, Llama 3.3 70B and GPT-OSS 120B) on a suite of forward-simulation tasks-including next / multistep state formulation, and legal action generation-across a diverse set of reasoning problems illustrated through General Game Playing (GGP) game instances. Beyond reporting instance-level performance, we characterize games based on 40 structural features and analyze correlations between these features and LLM performance. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of various game obfuscations to assess the role of linguistic semantics in game definitions and the impact of potential prior exposure of LLMs to specific games during training. The main results indicate that three of the evaluated models generally perform well across most experimental settings, with performance degradation observed as the evaluation horizon increases (i.e., with a higher number of game steps). Detailed case-based analysis of the LLM performance provides novel insights into common reasoning errors in the considered logic-based problem formulation, including hallucinated rules, redundant state facts, or syntactic errors. Overall, the paper reports clear progress in formal reasoning capabilities of contemporary models.",

However, checking the satisfiability of such specifications directly can be inefficient. A common optimization is to ground the specification - that is, to expand quantified formulas into equivalent variable-free formulas. While dedicated tools known as grounders are a cornerstone of Answer Set Programming (ASP) solvers, they are are largely absent from SMT solving workflows. As a result, users frequently resort to writing ad-hoc, error-prone code to perform this transformation.\n  In this work, I propose a theoretical framework for grounding first order logic formulas with aggregates, based on relational algebra. Within this framework, I formulate a method for efficiently grounding such formulas. Remarkably, the method allows certain formulas that quantify over infinite domains to be transformed into equivalent formulas of finite size.\n  I have implemented this method in a new SMT-LIB grounder, called xmt-lib. It leverages an embedded relational database (SQLite) to execute relational operations efficiently. An evaluation on a public benchmark for grounders demonstrates that xmt-lib significantly improves the performance of the Z3 SMT solver compared to its purely declarative use, and makes it com",

An analytical proof for the stability of the limit cycle has been formulated by using the Krylov Bogolyubov perturbation method. The multiple scales method has been modified to highlight an iterative algorithm for determining the order of approximation required to capture nonlinear effects. The describing function method is utilised to formulate an alternate amplitude. Comparisons between first order amplitudes obtained from perturbation analysis and the describing function formulations reveal conditions under which the two approaches converge.

With a rich history, these strong properties originate from various fields, including the inverse eigenvalue problem, the sign pattern problem, and structural graph theory. In this paper, we introduce a new strong property, the strong spectral property for weighted Laplacian matrices (SSPWL), and establish the corresponding Supergraph and Bifurcation lemmas. Instead of the space of symmetric matrices, the SSPWL considers the ambient space spanned by all weighted Laplacian matrices. Moreover, we provide a detailed study comparing the Jacobian Method and some strong properties, leading to a full understanding between these two techniques used in different problems. Using these tools, we identify the potential boundaries of the spectral regions of weighted Laplacian matrices associated with connected graphs on $4$ vertices, extending the analysis from the previous work [S.

For $k \\geq 1$, a $k$-partial coloring requires that each vertex $v$ in an $n$-node graph is assigned a color such that at least $\\min\\{k, °(v)\\}$ of its neighbors are assigned colors different from its own. This framework naturally extends classical coloring problems: specifically, $k$-partial $(k+1)$-coloring and $k$-partial $k$-coloring generalize $(Δ+1)$-proper coloring and $Δ$-proper coloring, respectively.\n  Prior works of Assadi, Chen, and Khanna [SODA~2019] and Assadi, Kumar, and Mittal [TheoretiCS~2023] show that both $(Δ+1)$-proper coloring and $Δ$-proper coloring admit one-pass randomized semi-streaming algorithms. We explore whether these efficiency gains extend to their partial coloring generalizations and reveal a sharp computational threshold : while $k$-partial $(k+1)$-coloring admits a one-pass randomized semi-streaming algorithm, the $k$-partial $k$-coloring remains semi-streaming intractable, effectively demonstrating a ``dichotomy of one color'' in the streaming model.",

          "summary": "We introduce the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Dynamics (KANDy) as a zero-depth, wide neural architecture capable of discovering governing equations in chaotic and complex dynamical systems. Building on the foundation of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), KANDy explicitly learns governing equations by replacing sparse regression with a KAN. The synthesis of KANs and sparse regression addresses the limitations of equation discovery for KANs applied to dynamical systems and overcomes cases where sparse regression is hindered by sparsity constraints. Additionally, we show that our model, applied to the Hopf Fibration, recovers topological structure, thereby improving coherence with attractor properties. We apply our model to discrete and continuous dynamical systems, as well as to chaotic partial differential equations (PDEs). These results position KANDy as an interpretable and effective alternative for data-driven modeling of nonlinear dynamical systems.",

          "summary": "Regime shifts in biology, ecology, and other complex systems are often interpreted through stability landscapes and early warning signals that implicitly assume dynamics without memory effects. Yet many real systems exhibit these effects, thus present dynamics depend on past states and past forcing. Here, we study how memory reshapes bistable stability landscapes and regime shifts using a minimal bistable model with a fractional derivative that controls memory strength. We connect landscape geometry to classical notions of resilience and resistance by quantifying basin curvature and the perturbation magnitude required to cross the unstable threshold, and we track how these quantities evolve in time after perturbations. Memory typically flattens basin floors, slowing recovery, while often increasing the perturbation threshold for stability transitions, revealing a tradeoff between resilience and resistance. Because the landscape becomes history-dependent and time-evolving, memory generates qualitative behaviors that do not appear in memory-free models, including delayed collapse or recovery after stress ends, rebound after apparently successful transition, and broadened hysteresis under gradual parameter change. Finally, we show that fitting a memory-free model to memory-driven data can reproduce trajectories while systematically shifting equilibrium branches and tipping locations, risking incorrect diagnosis and management of regime shifts. These results motivate a moving landscape view and provide practical guidance for interpreting observed anomalies and distinguishing memory-driven effects from noise.",

Although SimRank matrices and their computation require a significant amount of memory, common approaches mostly address the problem of algorithmic complexity. We propose two major formats for the economical embedding of target data. The first approach adopts a non-symmetric form that can be computed using a specialized alternating optimization algorithm. The second is based on a symmetric representation and Newton-type iterations. We propose numerical implementations for both methodologies that avoid working with dense matrices and maintain low memory consumption. Furthermore, we study both types of embeddings numerically using real data from publicly available datasets. The results show that our algorithms yield a good approximation of the SimRank matrices, both in terms of the error norm (particularly the Chebyshev norm) and in preserving the average number of the most similar elements for each given node.",

Such a problem may be naturally called tropical or \"max-plus\" optimal transportation problem. We show that the solutions to the latter, called the optimal tropical plans, may not correspond to perfect matchings even if the data (max-plus probability measures) have all weights equal to zero, in contrast with the classical discrete optimal transportation analogue, where perfect matching optimal plans in similar situations always exist. Nevertheless, in some randomized situation the existence of perfect matching optimal tropical plans may occur rather frequently. At last, we prove that the uniqueness of solutions of the optimal tropical transportation problem is quite rare.",

          "summary": "Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) are an expressive and intuitive means of representing complex probability distributions. In that realm, languages like Dice target an important class of probabilistic programs: those whose probability distributions are discrete. Discrete distributions are common in many fields, including text analysis, network verification, artificial intelligence, and graph analysis. Another important feature in the world of probabilistic modeling are nondeterministic choices as found in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) which play a major role in reinforcement learning. Modern PPLs usually lack support for nondeterminism. We address this gap with the introduction of noDice, which extends the discrete probabilistic inference engine Dice. noDice performs inference on loop-free programs by constructing an MDP so that the distributions modeled by the program correspond to schedulers in the MDP. Furthermore, decision diagrams are used as an intermediate step to exploit the program structure and drastically reduce the state space of the MDP.",

For principally polarized Abelian surfaces, a similar phenomenon has been observed by Bainbridge.",

          "summary": "Data-driven model identification strategies can be used to obtain phenomenological models that capture the temporal evolution of observable data. While it is usually straightforward to obtain such a model from time series data, for instance with least-squares fitting, it is generally difficult to quantify the uncertainty associated with the prediction of the temporal evolution of the observables. This paper considers a general framework for uncertainty quantification in data-driven dynamical models by framing prediction error through the lens of inverse problem theory. Building on Koopman-inspired model identification strategies that are suited for nonlinear dynamical models, we consider a prediction as an approximate measurement from which the original input state can be faithfully recovered, and define the prediction error as the MSE of solving the inverse problem that would yield this prediction. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach on both numerical models and experimental data showing that it provides a robust uncertainty measure of model performance.",

          "summary": "ODRL's six set-based operators -- isA, isPartOf, hasPart, isAnyOf, isAllOf, isNoneOf -- depend on external domain knowledge that the W3C specification leaves unspecified. Without it, every cross-dataspace policy comparison defaults to Unknown. We present a denotational semantics that maps each ODRL constraint to the set of knowledge-base concepts satisfying it. Conflict detection reduces to denotation intersection under a three-valued verdict -- Conflict, Compatible, or Unknown -- that is sound under incomplete knowledge. The framework covers all three ODRL composition modes (and, or, xone) and all three semantic domains arising in practice: taxonomic (class subsumption), mereological (part-whole containment), and nominal (identity). For cross-dataspace interoperability, we define order-preserving alignments between knowledge bases and prove two guarantees: conflicts are preserved across different KB standards, and unmapped concepts degrade gracefully to Unknown -- never to false conflicts. A runtime soundness theorem ensures that design-time verdicts hold for all execution contexts. The encoding stays within the decidable EPR fragment of first-order logic. We validate it with 154 benchmarks across six knowledge base families (GeoNames, ISO 3166, W3C DPV, a GDPR-derived taxonomy, BCP 47, and ISO 639-3) and four structural KBs targeting adversarial edge cases. Both the Vampire theorem prover and the Z3 SMT solver agree on all 154 verdicts. A key finding is that exclusive composition (xone) requires strictly stronger KB axioms than conjunction or disjunction: open-world semantics blocks exclusivity even when positive evidence appears to satisfy exactly one branch.",

          "summary": "Every ODRL 2.2 constraint compares a single scalar value: (leftOperand, operator, rightOperand). Five of ODRL's left operands, however, denote multi-dimensional quantities--image dimensions, canvas positions, geographic coordinates--whose specification text explicitly references multiple axes. For these operands, a single scalar constraint admits one interpretation per axis, making policy evaluation non-deterministic.\n  We classify ODRL's left operands by value-domain structure (scalar, dimensional, concept-valued), grounded in the ODRL 2.2 specification text, and show that dimensional ambiguity is intrinsic to the constraint syntax. We present an axis-decomposition framework that refines each dimensional operand into axis-specific scalar operands and prove four properties: deterministic interpretation, AABB completeness, projection soundness, and conservative extension.\n  Conflict detection operates in two layers: per-axis verdicts are always decidable; box-level verdicts compose through Strong Kleene conjunction into a three-valued logic (Conflict, Compatible, Unknown). For ODRL's disjunctive (odrl:or) and exclusive-or (odrl:xone) logical constraints, where per-axis decomposition does not apply, the framework encodes coupled multi-axis conjectures directly.\n  We instantiate the framework as the ODRL Spatial Axis Profile--15 axis-specific left operands for the five affected base terms--and evaluate it on 117 benchmark problems spanning nine categories across both TPTP FOF (Vampire) and SMT-LIB (Z3) encodings, achieving full concordance between provers.

          "summary": "Verified compilers aim to guarantee that compilation preserves the observable behavior of source programs. While small-step semantics are widely used in such compilers, they are not always the most convenient framework for structural transformations such as loop optimizations. This paper proposes an approach that leverages both small-step and big-step semantics: small-step semantics are used for local transformations, while big-step semantics are employed for structural transformations. An abstract behavioral semantics is introduced as a common interface between the two styles. Coinductive big-step semantics is extended to correctly handle divergence with both finite and infinite traces, bringing it on par with the expressiveness of small-step semantics. This enables the insertion of big-step transformations into the middle of an existing small-step pipeline, thereby fully preserving all top-level semantic preservation theorems. This approach is practically demonstrated in CompCert by implementing and verifying a few new loop optimizations in big-step Cminor, including loop unswitching and, notably, full loop unrolling.",

Habitats are fragmented into patches and we seek to reconnect each habitat such that it remains connected even if any of its patches becomes unavailable. Formally, we are given an undirected graph with edge costs, a set of fixed green bridges represented as a subset of the graph's edges, a set of habitats represented as vertex subsets, and some budget. We decide whether there exists a subset of the graph's edges containing all fixed green bridges such that, for each habitat, the induced subgraph on the solution edges is 2-vertex-connected, and the total cost does not exceed the budget. We also study the 2-edge-connectivity variant, modeling the case where any single reconnecting green bridge may fail. We analyze the computational complexity of these problems, focusing on the boundary between NP-hardness and polynomial-time solvability when the maximum habitat size and maximum vertex degree are bounded by constants. We prove that for each constant maximum habitat size of at least four there exists a small constant maximum degree for which the problems are NP-hard, and complement this with polynomial-time algorithms yielding partial dichotomies for bounded habitat size and degree.",

By reformulating reservoir dynamics in the eigenbasis of the recurrent matrix, the recurrent update becomes a set of independent element-wise operations, eliminating the matrix multiplication. We further propose three methods to use our optimization depending on the situation: (i) Eigenbasis Weight Transformation (EWT), which preserves the dynamics of standard and trained Linear ESNs, (ii) End-to-End Eigenbasis Training (EET), which directly optimizes readout weights in the transformed space and (iii) Direct Parameter Generation (DPG), that bypasses matrix diagonalization by directly sampling eigenvalues and eigenvectors, achieving comparable performance than standard Linear ESNs. Across all experiments, both our methods preserve predictive accuracy while offering significant computational speedups, making them a replacement of standard Linear ESNs computations and training, and suggesting a shift of paradigm in linear ESN towards the direct selection of eigenvalues.",

In this paper, we develop a comprehensive framework for rational maps between multigraded Proj schemes by introducing several notions of maps between their underlying multigraded rings. A key challenge is that to induce actual morphisms (rather than just rational maps), the ring homomorphism $\\varphi\\colon R \\to S$ must hit every relevant element in $S$. To address this, we introduce the use of relevant subsets $B \\subseteq S_+$ (where $S_+$ is the ideal generated by all relevant elements), $B \\unlhd S$, which allow us to control this condition more flexibly.\n  As an application, we show that multigraded noetherian polynomial rings naturally encode combinatorial data, giving rise to systems of fans and thus to toric prevarieties. By leveraging our notion of rational maps with those relevant subsets, we prove that the category of triples $(D, S, B)$ - where $D$ is a finitely generated abelian group, $S$ is a $D$-graded noetherian polynomial ring, and $B \\unlhd S$ is a subset of $S_+$ - together with rational maps of conical rings, is anti-equivalent to the category of simplicial toric prevarieties.",

This is motivated from educational scenarios where learners describe a formal language (presented, e.g., by a finite state automaton, regular expression, pushdown automaton, context-free grammar or in set notation) in natural language, and an educational support system has to (1) judge whether the natural-language description accurately describes the formal language, and to (2) provide explanations why descriptions are not accurate.\n  To address this question, we introduce a representation language for formal languages, Nile, which is designed so that Nile expressions can mirror the syntactic structure of natural-language descriptions of formal languages. Nile is sufficiently expressive to cover a broad variety of formal languages, including all regular languages and fragments of context-free languages typically used in educational contexts. Generating Nile expressions that are syntactically close to natural-language descriptions then allows to provide explanations for inaccuracies in the descriptions algorithmically.\n  In experiments on an educational data set, we show that LLMs can translate natural-language descriptions into equivalent, syntactically close Nile expressions with high accuracy - allowing to algorithmically provide explanations for incorrect natural-language descriptions. Our experiments also show that while natural-language descriptions can also be translated into regular expressions (but not context-free grammars), the expressions are often not syntactically close and thus not suitable for providing explanations.",

While periodic solutions at the particle level have been studied through the construction of a Poincaré map on a section of an invariant set, extending this analysis to the level of continuity equations presents nontrivial challenges. In particular, setting an appropriate topology for the infinite-dimensional space to show invariance and apply the fixed point argument is not easy. To overcome this difficulty, we use fixed point theorem for geodesically convex spaces constructed by optimal transportation. Specifically, from the disintegration with respect to stationary variable, we define a metric using the Wasserstein-$2$ distance over one-dimensional space, which yields a $CAT(0)$ space. In this topology, we construct an invariance set of probability measures and prove the existence of the periodic measure-valued solution from Schauder's fixed point theorem on geodesically convex spaces.

          "summary": "Let $c(G)$ denote the circumference of a graph $G$, i.e., the number of vertices in its longest cycle. For positive integers $n$ and $k$ with $n>k$, let $\\varGamma(n;k)$ be the class of graphs of order $n$ with $c(G) = n-k$ such that every induced subgraph of order $n-k$ is Hamiltonian. When $k=$, the class $\\varGamma(n; 1)$ coincides with the family of hypohamiltonian graphs-non-Hamiltonian graphs in which the deletion of any single vertex yields a Hamiltonian graph.Replacing Hamiltonian with traceable and $c(G)$ with $p(G)$, the order of a longest path, defines the analogous class $\\varPi(n;k)$.Grünbaum (1974) conjectured that both $\\varGamma(n; k)$ and $\\varPi(n; k)$ are empty for all $n>k \\ge 2$. In this note, we first establish upper bounds on the maximum degree of graphs in the classes $\\varGamma(n; k)$ and $\\varPi(n; k)$. Using these bounds, we show that $\\varGamma(n; k)$ is empty when $n<k^2+2k+3$, and that $\\varPi(n; k)$ is empty when $n<k^2+2k+2$. These results provide further evidence supporting Grünbaum's conjecture.",

          "summary": "Reasoning about concurrent programs executed on weak memory models is an inherently complex task. So far, existing proof calculi for weak memory models only cover safety properties. In this paper, we provide the first proof calculus for reasoning about liveness. Our proof calculus is based on Manna and Pnueli's proof rules for response under weak fairness, formulated in linear temporal logic. Our extension includes the incorporation of memory fairness into rules as well as the usage of ranking functions defined over weak memory state. We have applied our reasoning technique to the Ticket lock algorithm and have proved it to guarantee starvation freedom under memory models Release-Acquire and StrongCoherence for any number of concurrent threads.",

          "title": "Constrained graph generation: Preserving diameter and clustering coefficient simultaneously",
          "summary": "Generating graphs subject to strict structural constraints is a fundamental computational challenge in network science. Simultaneously preserving interacting properties-such as the diameter and the clustering coefficient- is particularly demanding. Simple constructive algorithms often fail to locate vanishingly small sets of feasible graphs, while traditional Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers suffer from severe ergodicity breaking. In this paper, we propose a two-step hybrid framework combining Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and MCMC sampling. First, we design a layered ACO heuristic to perform a guided global search, effectively locating valid graphs with prescribed diameter and clustering coefficient. Second, we use these ACO-designed graphs as structurally distinct seed states for an MCMC rewiring algorithm. We evaluate this framework across a wide range of graph edge densities and varying diameter-clustering-coefficient constraint regimes. Using the spectral distance of the normalized Laplacian to quantify structural diversity of the resulting graphs, our experiments reveal a sharp contrast between the methods. Standard MCMC samplers remain rigidly trapped in an isolated subset of feasible graphs around their initial seeds. Conversely, our hybrid ACO-MCMC approach successfully bridges disconnected configuration landscapes, generating a vastly richer and structurally diverse set of valid graphs.",

In this paper, we show that the matrix of Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of $\\mathcal{H}$ factorizes into a product of $|S|$ many matrices, each of which has entries as polynomials in $q$ with nonnegative coefficients. To achieve this goal, we use hybrid basis $TC^J$ for $J\\subseteq S$ of $\\mathcal{H}$, defined by Grojnowski-Haiman. The intermediate matrices in the aforementioned factorization turn out to be the transition matrices from $TC^J$-basis to $TC^I$-basis for $I\\subset J$. Equivalently, these coefficients can be computed using a natural restriction map from $\\mathcal{H}$ to the parabolic Hecke algebra $\\mathcal{H}_J$. Moreover, following the ideas from Grojnowski-Haiman, we also give a geometric proof of the positivity of these coefficients.",

          "summary": "The sandpile automata of Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld (Phys. Rev. Lett., 1987) are a simple model for the diffusion of particles in space. A fundamental problem related to the complexity of the model is predicting its evolution in the parallel setting. Despite decades of effort, a classification of this problem for two-dimensional sandpile automata remains outstanding. Fungal automata were recently proposed by Goles et al. (Phys. Lett. A, 2020) as a spin-off of the model in which diffusion occurs either in horizontal $(H)$ or vertical $(V)$ directions according to a so-called update scheme. Goles et al. proved that the prediction problem for this model with the update scheme $H^4V^4$ is $\\textbf{P}$-complete. This result was subsequently improved by Modanese and Worsch (Algorithmica, 2024), who showed the problem is $\\textbf{P}$-complete also for the simpler updatenscheme $HV$. In this work, we fill in the gaps and prove that the prediction problem is $\\textbf{P}$-complete for any update scheme that contains both $H$ and $V$ at least once.",

This applies both to compact operators on a single Banach space and to quasi-compact operators satisfying a Doeblin--Fortet--Lasota--Yorke inequality, extending Li's resolution of the Ulam conjecture from the invariant density to the entire discrete spectrum with certified error bounds at every finite truncation.\n  As a benchmark, we certify the first $50$ nonzero eigenvalues of the Gauss--Kuzmin--Wirsing operator to at least $90$ rigorous decimal digits, together with their eigenvectors, Riesz projectors, and spectral gap, yielding a certified spectral expansion for Gauss--Kuzmin distributions with explicit error bounds and providing a rigorous answer to the Gauss--Babenko--Knuth problem on the spectral data of the Gauss map.",

In this context, we study tail invariant measures on the path spaces of generalized Bratteli diagrams, allowing countably infinite vertex sets at each level. Our main focus is on subdiagrams of generalized Bratteli diagrams and the problem of extending tail invariant probability measures from vertex and edge subdiagrams to the ambient diagram. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the finiteness of such extensions, formulated in terms of incidence matrices and associated stochastic matrices. Several classes of generalized Bratteli diagrams and their subdiagrams are analyzed in detail, including simple, stationary, and bounded size diagrams. We develop constructive, step-by-step procedures for measure extension and for approximating invariant measures by measures supported on suitable subdiagrams. In addition, we provide explicit examples of generalized Bratteli diagrams that admit no probability tail invariant measures, a phenomenon absent for standard Bratteli diagrams with finite vertex sets. Finally, we address convergence questions for sequences of invariant measures arising from approximations by subdiagrams, clarifying the relationship between combinatorial structure and measure-theoretic behavior.",
